## General Information
- What is the background of your project?

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

They want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands


- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?

The aim of the project is to  to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.  



- What is the dataset that is being used?

Dataset is available in “.csv” format.
Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
## Data Visualization:
The analysis of categorical and numerical variables are done.
Categorical variables are analyse with box plot and count plots.
Numerical variables are analise with pairplots and heatmaps.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
## Data Splitting:
The given dataset is splitted into train and test dataset in 70-30 proportion.

## Model Building and Evaluation:
Total 4 models are build and 4th is finalise as our final model for prediction based on number of statistical parameters and evaluation.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
## Assumption Validation:
Linear regression assumptions are check whether they are valid for for final model or not.



<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
## Conclusions

At the end. we have identified the top most important features:
1. Temperature
2. Weathersit_3
3. Year
4. Windspeed 
5. season_4
